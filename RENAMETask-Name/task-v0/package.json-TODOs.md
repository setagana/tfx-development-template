These TODOs apply to the package.json file. JSON files don't support an easily-parsible comment format, so the TODOs are listed here separately.

Once all TODOs are completed, you can delete this file.

TODO: Check `scripts.mocha-test` value and adjust it to point to the entrypoint of your test suite.
